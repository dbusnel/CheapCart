## CheapCart

So the idea here is to collect a list of ingredients/groceries from the user, and then check the prices of those ingredients at nearby stores. Then, the lowest total costs are presented, accounting for sales and whatnot.

Now stores don't really like to give APIs to independent devs, and web scraping Instacart would be equal parts gruelling and legally treacherous, so this functionality will have to wait until there's better accessbility to food prices (if ever.)
